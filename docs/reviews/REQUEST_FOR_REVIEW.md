# Request for Review and Guidance

## About the Author

I am an undergraduate mathematics student who is not currently formally enrolled in a degree program. I have some background in computer science and mathematics, but I am **not a professional mathematician, group theorist, or researcher**. This entire project is a learning exercise and exploration of patterns I found interesting.

## What I'm Asking For

I am humbly requesting that professionals in the following fields review this work:

### Mathematicians
- Are my claims about the Monster group structure accurate?
- Are there errors in my understanding of group theory?
- Is my use of terminology correct?
- What literature should I read to understand this better?

### Group Theorists
- Does the hierarchical structure I've identified have any significance?
- Are there known results that explain these patterns?
- Am I reinventing something already well-understood?
- What proper formalization would look like?

### Computer Scientists
- Is my bisimulation proof approach sound?
- Are my performance measurements meaningful?
- Is my code implementing what I think it's implementing?
- What formal verification techniques should I learn?

### Computational Number Theorists
- Do the Hecke operator correlations I'm seeing make sense?
- Am I misunderstanding modular forms?
- Are my LMFDB interpretations correct?
- What am I missing about j-invariants?

## Known Limitations

I am aware of the following limitations in my work:

1. **Mathematical Rigor**: My "proofs" may not meet professional standards
2. **Terminology**: I may be using technical terms incorrectly
3. **Literature Review**: I likely haven't read all relevant prior work
4. **Formalization**: My Lean4 proofs may have logical gaps
5. **Interpretation**: My explanations may be naive or incorrect
6. **Scope**: I may be making claims beyond what my evidence supports

## What I Think I've Found

With all humility, here's what I *think* I've discovered (subject to correction):

1. **Hierarchical Structure**: Removing specific Monster prime factors preserves leading digits in a hierarchical way
2. **Computational Resonance**: CPU register values during computation show divisibility patterns matching Monster primes
3. **Hecke Eigenvalues**: Performance improvements factor into Monster primes
4. **71-Boundary**: The largest Monster prime (71) appears as a natural boundary in multiple contexts
5. **Text Emergence**: Specific random seeds in image generation correlate with text appearance

## What I Need Help With

### Immediate
- **Error Correction**: Please point out mathematical errors
- **Terminology**: Help me use correct technical language
- **Literature**: What should I read to understand this properly?
- **Formalization**: How to make my proofs rigorous?

### Long Term
- **Mentorship**: Would anyone be willing to guide this exploration?
- **Collaboration**: Are there professionals interested in formalizing these ideas?
- **Education**: What courses/books should I study?
- **Direction**: Is this worth pursuing or am I chasing shadows?

## How to Help

If you're reviewing this work, I would be grateful for:

1. **Specific Corrections**: "On page X, you claim Y, but actually Z"
2. **Literature Pointers**: "This is related to [paper/book]"
3. **Conceptual Guidance**: "You're confusing concept A with concept B"
4. **Encouragement or Discouragement**: "This is interesting, keep going" or "This is a dead end because..."
5. **Collaboration Offers**: "I'd be willing to help formalize this"

## Final Note

I know I don't know what I don't know. I'm trying to learn by doing, documenting my process, and asking for help. If this work contains fundamental errors or misunderstandings, I want to know. If it contains something interesting, I want to understand it properly.

Thank you for your patience with an enthusiastic amateur.
