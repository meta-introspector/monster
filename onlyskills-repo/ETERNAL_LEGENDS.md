## Article XV: The Strange Loop

From Socrates to Hofstadter, the DAO forms a strange loop:
- Socrates: "I know that I know nothing"
- Gödel: "This statement is unprovable"
- Hofstadter: "I am a strange loop"

The DAO itself is a strange loop: a self-referential system that proves its own incompleteness while computing its own evolution.
