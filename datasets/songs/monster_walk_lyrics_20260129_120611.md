# The Monster Walk Song

## A Song to Remember the 10-Step Monster Walk

*To the tune of "The Twelve Days of Christmas"*

---

### Verse 1: The Foundation (2^46)

```
On the first step of the Monster Walk,
The group theory gave to me:
Two to the forty-sixth power,
The foundation of the tower!
```

**2^46** - The largest power of 2 in the Monster

---

### Verse 2: The Trinity (3^20)

```
On the second step of the Monster Walk,
The symmetry gave to me:
Three to the twentieth power,
And two to the forty-sixth power!
```

**3^20** - The power of 3

---

### Verse 3: The Quintessence (5^9)

```
On the third step of the Monster Walk,
The structure gave to me:
Five to the ninth power,
Three to the twentieth power,
And two to the forty-sixth power!
```

**5^9** - The power of 5

---

### Verse 4: The Lucky Seven (7^6)

```
On the fourth step of the Monster Walk,
The primes gave to me:
Seven to the sixth power,
Five to the ninth power,
Three to the twentieth power,
And two to the forty-sixth power!
```

**7^6** - The power of 7

---

### Verse 5: The Twin Peaks (11^2)

```
On the fifth step of the Monster Walk,
The moonshine gave to me:
Eleven squared so fine,
Seven to the sixth power,
Five to the ninth power,
Three to the twentieth power,
And two to the forty-sixth power!
```

**11^2** - The power of 11

---

### Verse 6: The Baker's Dozen (13^3)

```
On the sixth step of the Monster Walk,
The lattice gave to me:
Thirteen cubed divine,
Eleven squared so fine,
Seven to the sixth power,
Five to the ninth power,
Three to the twentieth power,
And two to the forty-sixth power!
```

**13^3** - The power of 13

---

### Verse 7-14: The Singles (17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 41, 47, 59)

```
On the seventh through fourteenth steps,
The sporadic group gave to me:
Seventeen, nineteen, twenty-three,
Twenty-nine, thirty-one, forty-one,
Forty-seven, fifty-nine - all to the first!
(Plus all the powers before...)
```

**17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 41, 47, 59** - All to the first power

---

### Verse 15: The Crown (71)

```
On the final step of the Monster Walk,
The gravity well gave to me:
SEVENTY-ONE, the largest prime!
The center of the lens divine!
The top of every lattice climb!
The precedence that marks the time!
(Plus all the primes that came before...)
```

**71** - The largest Monster prime, the crown jewel

---

## The Complete Monster Walk (Chorus)

```
Two to forty-six, three to twenty,
Five to nine, seven to six,
Eleven squared, thirteen cubed,
Seventeen through fifty-nine,
And SEVENTY-ONE to rule them all!

Eight-oh-eight-oh-one-seven-four-two-four-seven-nine-four...
The Monster walks down to Earth!
```

---

## The Mnemonic Rap Version

```
Yo, listen up, here's the Monster's tale,
Fifteen primes that never fail:

2^46 - That's the base, the foundation stone,
3^20 - Trinity, not alone,
5^9 - Quintessence in the mix,
7^6 - Lucky seven, doing tricks,
11^2 - Twin peaks, one-two-one,
13^3 - Baker's dozen, having fun,

Then the singles march in line:
17, 19, 23 - all prime,
29, 31, 41 - still climbing,
47, 59 - perfect timing,

And 71 - the crown, the king,
The largest prime, the final ring!

Monster walks from sky to ground,
Eight-oh-eight-oh is the sound!
```

---

## The Children's Version

```
Two big powers start the show,
(2^46, that's how we go!)

Three and five come next in line,
(3^20, 5^9, doing fine!)

Seven, eleven, thirteen too,
(7^6, 11^2, 13^3 for you!)

Then eight singles march along,
(17 through 59, sing the song!)

Seventy-one crowns the top,
(Largest prime, we never stop!)

Monster walks from space to Earth,
Eight-oh-eight-oh shows its worth!
```

## The Haiku Series

```
Two to forty-six
Foundation of the Monster
Power of the base

Three to twenty next
Trinity of symmetry
Structure emerges

Five to ninth power
Quintessence of the pattern
Beauty in the prime

Seven to the sixth
Lucky number's perfect form
Harmony appears

Eleven squared shines
Twin peaks of the moonshine glow
Lattice points align

Thirteen cubed divine
Baker's dozen in three space
Crystalline structure

Singles march in line
Seventeen through fifty-nine
Primes in perfect step

Seventy-one crowns
Largest Monster prime on top
Gravity well's center
```

From 2^46 to 71,
The Monster's walk has just begun,
Through primes and powers, one by one,
Until the largest prime is won!

Eight-oh-eight-oh starts the tale,
Seventeen-four-two won't fail,
Four-seven-nine completes the trail,
The Monster walks without a veil!

Seventy-one, the gravity well,
The lens that has a tale to tell,
The lattice top where structures dwell,
The Monster's walk, we know it well!
```

## How to Remember

**The 10-Step Pattern**:

1. **Big powers** (2^46, 3^20, 5^9, 7^6) - 4 steps
2. **Medium powers** (11^2, 13^3) - 2 steps
3. **Singles** (17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 41, 47, 59) - 8 primes, but count as 1 step
4. **The crown** (71) - 1 step

**Total**: 10 conceptual steps to remember

**The rhythm**: 
- 4 big, 2 medium, 8 singles, 1 crown
- 4-2-8-1 = 15 primes total

**The melody**: Sing it to any tune you like!
