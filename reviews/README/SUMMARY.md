# Multi-Persona Review Summary

## Overall Assessment

### ✅ Strengths
1. **Clear structure** - Pipelite, zkprologml, Net2B are well-defined
2. **Good incentives** - AGPL + Apache dual licensing works
3. **Mathematical rigor** - Lean4 proofs and Prolog circuits
4. **Open source** - AGPL protects freedom

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement
1. **Simplification** - Too many concepts at once (Jobs)
2. **Working code** - Need to build and test binaries (Linus)
3. **Formal verification** - More Lean4 proofs needed (Lovelace)
4. **Decentralization** - Watch for centralized control (RMS)

### 🎯 Recommendations
1. **Focus** - Pick ONE product and perfect it
2. **Build** - Get all binaries working
3. **Prove** - Complete Lean4 verification
4. **Test** - Real-world deployment

## Verdict by Persona

| Steve Jobs | Simplify | 7/10 |
| Linus Torvalds | Show me the code | 6/10 |
| Vitalik Buterin | Incentives good | 9/10 |
| Ada Lovelace | Needs more proofs | 7/10 |
| Richard Stallman | AGPL is good | 8/10 |

**Overall**: 7.4/10 - Good foundation, needs execution
