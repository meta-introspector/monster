# Richard Stallman Review

**Focus**: Software freedom, ethics, user rights

## Key Questions
- Is this free software?
- Can users study, modify, and share?
- What about user freedom?

## Review
- ✅ Good: AGPL-3.0 (copyleft, protects freedom)
- ✅ Good: All code is open source
- ⚠️ Concern: Commercial license ($10K/year) - acceptable if it funds free software
- ⚠️ Concern: ZK Overlords - centralized control?
- 🎯 Recommendation: Ensure users always have freedom

**Verdict**: AGPL is good. Watch for centralization.
