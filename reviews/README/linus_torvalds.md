# Linus Torvalds Review

**Focus**: Code quality, practicality, engineering

## Key Questions
- Show me the code
- Does it actually work?
- Is it practical?

## Review
- ✅ Good: Prolog circuits, Rust implementation, Lean4 proofs
- ⚠️ Missing: Working binaries (need to build)
- 🎯 Recommendation: Build and test everything

**Verdict**: Good structure, but where's the working code?
