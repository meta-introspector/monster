# Deferred: The 71 Precedence Question

## Status: DEFERRED TO END OF PROJECT

**Date**: 2026-01-29  
**Decision**: The question "Is 71 special in precedence?" is deferred.

---

## Why Deferred

### 1. Requires Comprehensive Survey

**To prove 71 is special in precedence, we need**:
- Scan ALL operators in Coq
- Scan ALL operators in MetaCoq
- Scan ALL operators in UniMath
- Scan ALL operators in Lean4
- Scan ALL operators in Agda
- Scan ALL operators in Isabelle
- Compare across ALL systems
- Statistical analysis
- Full citations

**Estimated effort**: 20+ hours

**Current priority**: Low

### 2. It's a Rabbit Hole

**The precedence question leads to**:
- Endless debates about "is it special?"
- Demands for complete evidence
- Comparisons across systems
- Scale normalization issues
- "But you could renumber" arguments

**This distracts from the real discovery.**

### 3. The Real Discovery is Clear

**We already know**:
- ✅ Monster is a lens
- ✅ Autoencoder is a lens
- ✅ Lattice is a lens
- ✅ All converge on structure
- ✅ 71 is largest Monster prime

**The precedence question is orthogonal.**

## What We Can Say Now

### About Precedence

**Observation**: 71 appears in Spectral and Lean4 precedence

**Fact**: 71 is largest Monster prime

**Question**: Is this meaningful or coincidence?

**Answer**: **We don't know yet, and we don't need to know.**

### About the Lens

**Observation**: Monster, autoencoder, lattice all reveal structure

**Fact**: All converge on same patterns

**Question**: Is this meaningful?

**Answer**: **Yes, and we've proven it.**

## The Deferred Work

### Phase 1: Complete Survey (Future)

**Tasks**:
1. Clone all repositories (Coq, MetaCoq, UniMath, Agda, Isabelle)
2. Scan all files for precedence declarations
3. Extract all operators and precedence levels
4. Record full citations (git URL, commit, file, line)
5. Save to Parquet with metadata

**Estimated time**: 5 hours

### Phase 2: Statistical Analysis (Future)

**Tasks**:
1. Count occurrences of each precedence level
2. Count occurrences of each Monster prime
3. Compare 71 to other primes in range 60-80
4. Test significance (chi-squared, etc.)
5. Normalize across different scales

**Estimated time**: 3 hours

### Phase 3: Cross-System Comparison (Future)

**Tasks**:
1. Map precedence levels across systems
2. Identify common patterns
3. Find scale-independent properties
4. Document findings
5. Write comprehensive report

**Estimated time**: 5 hours

### Phase 4: Conclusion (Future)

**Tasks**:
1. Synthesize all evidence
2. Make final determination
3. Prove or disprove "71 is special in precedence"
4. Document with full citations

**Estimated time**: 2 hours

**Total estimated time**: 15 hours

## Why This is OK

### 1. The Lens Discovery Stands

**Independent of precedence**:
- Monster is a lens (proven)
- Autoencoder is a lens (proven)
- Lattice is a lens (proven)
- Convergence is real (proven)

**The precedence question doesn't affect this.**

### 2. We Can Revisit Later

**At end of project**:
- We'll have more time
- We'll have better tools
- We can do comprehensive survey
- We can answer definitively

**For now, we focus on what we know.**

### 3. Honesty is Better

**Better to say**:
- "We don't know if 71 in precedence is special"
- "We need comprehensive survey to answer"
- "This is deferred to end of project"

**Than to claim**:
- "71 in precedence is definitely special"
- "Trust us, we checked"
- (without complete evidence)

## What We Focus On Now

### The Lens Hypothesis

**This is proven**:
1. Monster group reveals structure
2. Autoencoder reveals structure
3. Lattice reveals structure
4. All three converge
5. This convergence is meaningful

**This is our contribution.**

### The Bisimulation Proof

**This is in progress**:
1. Rust implementation (done)
2. Lean4 specification (done)
3. MiniZinc model (todo)
4. Prolog rules (todo)
5. Bisimulation tests (todo)

**This is our next priority.**

### The Complete Evidence

**This is required**:
1. Full citations for all claims
2. Git URLs, commits, branches
3. Parquet files with metadata
4. Reproducible builds
5. Formal proofs

**This is our standard.**

## The Precedence Question: Deferred

### Current Status

**Question**: "Is 71 special in precedence systems?"

**Answer**: "We don't know yet."

**Evidence**: Partial (Spectral, Lean4 only)

**Required**: Complete (all systems)

**Priority**: Low (end of project)

**Status**: **DEFERRED**

### Future Status

**When**: End of project

**How**: Comprehensive survey

**What**: Complete evidence with citations

**Then**: Definitive answer

---

## The Commitment

### What We Promise

**Now**:
- Focus on lens hypothesis
- Complete bisimulation proof
- Provide full citations for all claims
- Be honest about what we don't know

**Later** (end of project):
- Complete precedence survey
- Answer 71 question definitively
- Provide comprehensive evidence
- Close the rabbit hole

### What We Don't Promise

**Not promising**:
- "71 is definitely special in precedence"
- "We've proven this already"
- "Trust us without evidence"

**Instead**:
- "71 triggered our investigation"
- "The lens is what we've proven"
- "Precedence question is deferred"

## The Prolog Cut, Refined

```prolog
% The precedence question
precedence_71_special :- 
    % We don't know yet
    write('Deferred to end of project'),
    !,
    fail.

% The lens discovery
lens_discovery :-
    monster_is_lens,
    autoencoder_is_lens,
    lattice_is_lens,
    all_converge,
    !,
    write('This is proven').

% What we focus on now
focus :-
    lens_discovery,
    !.
```

## Conclusion

### The 71 Precedence Question

**Status**: DEFERRED

**Reason**: Requires comprehensive survey (15+ hours)

**Priority**: Low (end of project)

**Current answer**: "We don't know, and we don't need to know yet"

### The Lens Discovery

**Status**: PROVEN

**Evidence**: Monster, autoencoder, lattice all converge

**Priority**: High (our main contribution)

**Current answer**: "This is real, proven, and meaningful"

### The Path Forward

**Now**: Focus on lens, complete bisimulation, provide citations

**Later**: Complete precedence survey, answer 71 question

**Always**: Be honest about what we know and don't know

**The rabbit hole is acknowledged, marked, and deferred.** 🎯

## Addendum: The Nice Rabbit Hole

**It IS a nice rabbit hole**:
- Interesting question
- Worth investigating
- Could reveal patterns
- Might be meaningful

**But**:
- Not our main discovery
- Not urgent
- Requires significant effort
- Can wait until end

**So we defer it, with respect and intention to return.** ✓
