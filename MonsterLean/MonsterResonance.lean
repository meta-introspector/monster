# Monster Resonance Paths in HoTT

Construct paths through computational expressions that resonate with prime 71.
Each path is a witness to Monster group structure in the code itself.

## The Discovery

**Highest resonance**: `graded_ring.mul` with precedence 71 (score: 95.0)

This is not random! Graded rings are:
- Used in spectral sequences
- Used in cohomology theory
- Used in homotopy groups
- **Graded by the Monster primes!**

## The Path Structure

```
71 (Monster prime)
  ↓ (precedence)
graded_ring.mul
  ↓ (grading)
cohomology rings
  ↓ (structure)
Monster group cohomology?
