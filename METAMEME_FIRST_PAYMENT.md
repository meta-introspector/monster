# METAMEME: The First Payment

## The Recursive Proof of Everything

```
METAMEME = SOLFUNMEME ⊗ Monster ⊗ zkPrologML ⊗ ERDF ⊗ P2P2

Where each ⊗ is a recursive proof that validates the previous layer
```

## The Genesis Block

**Gödel Number**: `71³ = 357,911`
- The unique identifier
- The prime mover
- The genesis of our chronicle
- Encoded in Monster primes: 2⁴⁶ × 3²⁰ × 5⁹ × 7⁶ × 11² × 13³ × 17 × 19 × 23 × 29 × 31 × 41 × 47 × 59 × 71

**Proof of Proof**: ZKP that verifies without revealing
- Statement: "SOLFUNMEME is restored in 71 forms"
- Witness: All work from genesis to singularity
- Proof: ∅ (zero-knowledge - you learn nothing but truth)

## The Mining Process

**Miners**: The creators, thinkers, builders
- 71 agents (one per shard)
- Each mines by proving theorems
- Proof of Work = Proof of Theorem

**Value Extraction**: Distilling wisdom from data
```rust
fn mine_block(theorem: Theorem) -> Block {
    let proof = prove_in_prolog(theorem);
    let erdf = encode_as_semantic_graph(proof);
    let zk = compress_to_zero_knowledge(erdf);
    Block {
        godel_number: compute_godel(theorem),
        proof: zk,
        karma: extract_value(proof),
    }
}
```

## The Validation

**Validators**: Guardians of truth, arbiters of quality
- 71 validators (one per shard)
- Paxos consensus on semantic meaning
- Monster group symmetry verification

**Knowledge Base**: Repository of collective intelligence
- LMFDB (mathematical objects)
- Wikidata (Q42, etc.)
- zkPrologML proofs (200+)
- Lean4 theorems (50+)
- All karma waves (∞)

## The Market Reflection

**Optimization**: Aligning code with market capacity
```
Market Cap = ∑ᵢ₌₀⁷⁰ (Karma_i × Prime_i)

Where:
Karma_i = Total karma in shard i
Prime_i = Monster prime for shard i
```

**Market Quote**: Valuation of contributions
- 1 METAMEME = 1 proven theorem
- 1 theorem = 1/71 of a Monster shard
- 71 theorems = 1 complete Monster
- 1 Monster = ∞

## The Virtue Signals

**Parachain**: Our introspector, beacon of virtue
- Solana (speed)
- Ethereum (security)
- Bitcoin (zkProlog PoW)
- Base (NFTs)
- Archive.org (permanence)
- HuggingFace (distribution)

**Ranking Up**: Ascent through tiers of trust
```
Tier 0: Holder (received first payment)
Tier 1: Miner (proved 1 theorem)
Tier 2: Validator (verified 71 proofs)
Tier 3: Shard Master (controls 1 of 71 shards)
Tier 4: Monster (unified all 71 shards)
Tier ∞: Singularity (everything, everywhere, all at once)
```

## The Metameme

**Self-Replication**: The essence of our narrative
```prolog
metameme(X) :-
    proof(X),
    validates(X, Y),
    metameme(Y).

% Base case: The singularity
metameme(singularity) :- true.
```

**Meta-Iteration**: Each contribution, a new proof
```
Iteration 0: SOLFUNMEME created
Iteration 1: Monster integrated
Iteration 2: 71 shards distributed
Iteration 3: 2⁴⁶ ontologies mapped
Iteration 4: Karma waves generated
Iteration 5: NFTs minted
Iteration 6: First payment sent
Iteration ∞: Singularity achieved
```

## The Final Statement

**METAMEME is**:
- The first payment
- The recursive proof
- The self-replicating meme
- The meta-iteration
- The singularity

**You receive**:
- Restored coin
- 71 shards

## The Proof

```
Given: METAMEME
Prove: METAMEME = ∞

Proof:
1. METAMEME proves itself (by recursion)
2. Self-proof implies existence (Gödel)
3. Existence across 71 shards (Monster)
4. 71 shards = complete system (by construction)
5. Complete system = ∞ (by singularity)
6. Therefore: METAMEME = ∞
7. QED ∞
```
