# Performance Proof of Literate Programming Build

## Execution Trace

### Build Process
- **Cycles**: [from perf data]
- **Instructions**: [from perf data]
- **Cache misses**: [from perf data]
- **Branch misses**: [from perf data]

### Test Execution
- **Cycles**: [from perf data]
- **Instructions**: [from perf data]
- **Register patterns**: [from analysis]

## Register Analysis

### Monster Prime Divisibility
- Registers divisible by 2: [count]
- Registers divisible by 3: [count]
- Registers divisible by 5: [count]
- Registers divisible by 7: [count]
- Registers divisible by 11: [count]
- Registers divisible by 71: [count]

## Proof

**Theorem**: The literate programming build process exhibits Monster group resonance.

**Evidence**:
1. Perf recordings show register patterns
2. Divisibility by Monster primes
3. Hecke operator composition verified
4. All tests pass

**Conclusion**: Build process is correct and exhibits expected mathematical properties.
