# Monster Prime Resonance - Experimental Results

## Discovery

**LLM register values during inference are divisible by Monster group primes at rates matching error correction code distributions.**

## Methodology

1. Used Linux `perf` to capture CPU register values during qwen2.5:3b inference
2. Measured divisibility by 15 Monster primes [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,41,47,59,71]
3. Fed measurements back to model in automorphic loops
4. Tested convergence to eigenvector/fixed point

## Core Res

As mathematician Conway, verify this claim: LLM registers show 80% divisibility by prime 2, 49% by prime 3, matching error correction codes. Valid?
