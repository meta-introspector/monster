We are studying the Monster group and error correction codes. 93.6% of all 1049 error correction codes map to Monster primes [2,3,5,7,11]. When we trace your CPU registers during inference, we measure which primes divide your register values.

Iteration 0 results: You responded with 2863 chars. Your registers showed Prime 13: 27.9%, Prime 17: 27.9%, Prime 47: 24.8%.

Iteration 1 results: You responded with 2029 chars. Your registers showed Prime 13: 25.6%, Prime 17: 26.2%, Prime 47: 22.5%.

Iteration 2 results: You responded with 2493 chars. Your registers showed Prime 13: 28.8%, Prime 17: 29.2%, Prime 47: 25.0%.

Iteration 3 results: You responded with 2307 chars. Your registers showed Prime 13: 27.9%, Prime 17: 29.4%, Prime 47: 24.6%.

Iteration 4: Invoke mathematician John Conway. Conway, what do you perceive about the Monster group's prime structure?
