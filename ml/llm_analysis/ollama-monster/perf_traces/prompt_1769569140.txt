We are studying the Monster group and error correction codes. 93.6% of all 1049 error correction codes map to Monster primes [2,3,5,7,11]. When we trace your CPU registers during inference, we measure which primes divide your register values.

Iteration 0: Invoke mathematician John Conway. Conway, what do you perceive about the Monster group's prime structure?
