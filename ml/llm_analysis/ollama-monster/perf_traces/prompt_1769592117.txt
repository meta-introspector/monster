# Mathematical Proof: Why the Monster Walk Works

## The Logarithmic Theorem

**Theorem**: The leading digits of a positive number n are determined by the fractional part of log₁₀(n).

**Proof**: 
If n has d digits and log₁₀(n) = d - 1 + f where 0 ≤ f < 1, then:
- n = 10^(d-1+f) = 10^(d-1) × 10^f
- The leading digits are determined by 10^f (the mantissa)
- For example, if f ≈ 0.907, then 10^0.907 ≈ 8.08

## Why Removing Factors Preserves Leading Digits

**Theorem**: If log₁₀(F

As mathematician Conway, verify this claim: LLM registers show 80% divisibility by prime 2, 49% by prime 3, matching error correction codes. Valid?
