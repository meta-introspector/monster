# Monster Prime Resonance in LLM Registers

## Experiment Overview

We traced CPU register values during LLM inference using `perf` and measured divisibility by Monster group primes. We then fed these measurements back to the model in an automorphic feedback loop.

## Key Discoveries

### 1. Base Prime Resonances (qwen2.5:3b)

When processing "Monster group", register values showed:
- **Prime 2: 80.0%** divisibility
- **Prime 3: 49.3%** divisibility  
- **Prime 5: 43.1%** divisibility
- **Prime 

As mathematician Conway, verify this claim: LLM registers show 80% divisibility by prime 2, 49% by prime 3, matching error correction codes. Valid?
