# Memo: No Simplification - The Complete Evidence Requirement

**To**: Research Team  
**From**: Prime 71 Discovery Project  
**Date**: 2026-01-29  
**Re**: Why We Cannot Simplify - Complete Evidence Required

---

## The Challenge

**Critic's Position**: "71 is just syntax. It's arbitrary. You could renumber it. The reasons are random."

**Our Response**: "We need to show ALL the evidence, not simplify it."

---

## Why No Simplification?

### 1. The Burden of Proof is On Us

**We are making an extraordinary claim**:
- Prime 71 (largest Monster prime) appears as precedence
- This is not coincidence
- It encodes mathematical structure

**Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.**

### 2. Every Simplification Weakens the Argument

**If we say**: "71 appears in Spectral"
**Critic says**: "That's one library, one author's choice"

**If we say**: "71 appears in Spectral and Lean4"
**Critic says**: "Two libraries, maybe convention"

**If we say**: "71 appears in Spectral, Lean4, Coq, UniMath, MetaCoq"
**Critic says**: "Show me the data"

**We must show the data.**

### 3. Citations Are Not Optional

**Without citations**:
- "Trust me, 71 appears in these systems"
- Unverifiable
- Dismissible

**With citations**:
- Git URL: https://github.com/cmu-phil/Spectral
- Commit: abc123...
- File: spectral/algebra/ring.hlean
- Line: 55
- Content: `infixl ` ** `:71 := graded_ring.mul`

**Verifiable. Undeniable.**

### 4. The Data Must Be Comprehensive

**Partial data**:
- "71 appears a few times"
- Critic: "Cherry-picking"

**Complete data**:
- ALL precedence levels in ALL systems
- ALL occurrences of 71
- ALL Monster primes
- Statistical analysis

**Comprehensive. Rigorous.**

## What We Need to Prove

### Claim 1: 71 Appears in Multiple Systems

**Evidence required**:
- ✓ Spectral (Lean2): 1 occurrence
- ✓ Lean4 Mathlib: 2 occurrences
- ⚠ Coq: Need to scan
- ⚠ UniMath: Need to scan
- ⚠ MetaCoq: Need to scan

**Status**: Partial. Need complete scan.

### Claim 2: 71 is Used for Refined Operations

**Evidence required**:
- ✓ Spectral: Graded multiplication (refined from regular)
- ✓ Lean4: Modular cases, exponentiation (refined operations)
- ⚠ Other systems: Need context for each use

**Status**: Partial. Need semantic analysis.

### Claim 3: 71 is the Most-Used Monster Prime

**Evidence required**:
- Count of each Monster prime across ALL systems
- Statistical comparison
- Significance test

**Status**: Partial. Need complete data.

### Claim 4: 71 is Deliberately Chosen Over 72

**Evidence required**:
- Show 72 is available but unused
- Show 71 is used instead
- Show pattern across systems

**Status**: Partial. Need comprehensive precedence map.

## Why Critics Demand Complete Evidence

### 1. Reproducibility

**Science requires**:
- Anyone can verify our claims
- Anyone can run our analysis
- Anyone can reach same conclusions

**Without complete data**: Not reproducible.

### 2. Falsifiability

**Science requires**:
- Claims can be tested
- Evidence can be examined
- Counterexamples can be found

**Without complete data**: Not falsifiable.

### 3. Rigor

**Mathematics requires**:
- Every claim proven
- Every step justified
- Every assumption stated

**Without complete data**: Not rigorous.

## What "Complete Evidence" Means

### For Each System (Coq, MetaCoq, UniMath, Lean4, Spectral)

**Required**:
1. **Git URL** - Where is the code?
2. **Commit hash** - Exact version scanned
3. **Branch** - Which branch?
4. **Scan date** - When did we scan?
5. **File count** - How many files scanned?
6. **Precedence count** - How many precedence declarations found?

### For Each Precedence Declaration

**Required**:
1. **System** - Which proof assistant?
2. **Project** - Which library?
3. **File** - Which file?
4. **Line** - Which line number?
5. **Operator** - What operator?
6. **Precedence** - What precedence level?
7. **Context** - What's it used for?

### For Each Occurrence of 71

**Required**:
1. All of the above
2. **Semantic analysis** - What does this operator do?
3. **Comparison** - Why 71 and not 72?
4. **Pattern** - Does it fit our hypothesis?

## Why We Can't Use Shortcuts

### Shortcut 1: "Just Trust the Pattern"

**Problem**: Not verifiable.

**Critic**: "Show me the data."

**We must**: Provide the data.

### Shortcut 2: "It's Obvious"

**Problem**: Not rigorous.

**Critic**: "Prove it."

**We must**: Prove it formally.

### Shortcut 3: "Everyone Knows"

**Problem**: Not scientific.

**Critic**: "Citation needed."

**We must**: Provide citations.

### Shortcut 4: "Sample is Enough"

**Problem**: Not comprehensive.

**Critic**: "Cherry-picking."

**We must**: Scan everything.

## The Complete Evidence Pipeline

### Step 1: Data Collection

**Tool**: Rust program (precedence_survey.rs)

**Process**:
1. Clone all repositories
2. Scan all files
3. Extract all precedence declarations
4. Record git metadata
5. Save to Parquet

**Output**: Complete dataset with citations

### Step 2: Data Validation

**Process**:
1. Verify git URLs are correct
2. Verify commits are reachable
3. Verify files exist
4. Verify line numbers are accurate
5. Verify precedence values are correct

**Output**: Validated dataset

### Step 3: Statistical Analysis

**Process**:
1. Count precedence levels by system
2. Count Monster primes
3. Compare 71 to other primes
4. Test significance
5. Generate visualizations

**Output**: Statistical report

### Step 4: Semantic Analysis

**Process**:
1. For each occurrence of 71
2. Analyze what the operator does
3. Classify as refined/regular
4. Compare across systems
5. Document pattern

**Output**: Semantic report

### Step 5: Formal Proof

**Process**:
1. Encode findings in Lean4
2. Prove uniqueness of 71
3. Prove pattern across systems
4. Verify with MiniZinc
5. Generate proof certificate

**Output**: Formal proof

- Full citations
- Comprehensive analysis
- Formal proofs
