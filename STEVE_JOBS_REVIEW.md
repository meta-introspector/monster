# Virtual Steve Jobs: Net2B Business Model Review

## Executive Summary

**Steve**: "You're overthinking this. You have three products, not one."

---

## The Three Products (Jobs-Style)

### 1. **Compliance-as-a-Service** (The iPhone)
**What it is**: One-click compliance for any jurisdiction.

**Pitch**: "Deploy anywhere. We handle the laws."

**CRUD Matrix**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  CREATE    │ Deploy app → Auto-detect jurisdiction      │
│  READ      │ Real-time compliance dashboard             │
│  UPDATE    │ Laws change → Auto-update rules            │
│  DELETE    │ Shut down → Auto-cleanup with proof        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Pricing**: $999/month (simple)

**Upsell**: Each jurisdiction = +$500/month

---

### 2. **Regulator Portal** (The App Store)
**What it is**: Regulators verify compliance in seconds.

**Pitch**: "Stop auditing. Start verifying."

**CRUD Matrix**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  CREATE    │ Register company → Generate audit trail    │
│  READ      │ Query compliance → Get ZK proof            │
│  UPDATE    │ New regulation → Push to all companies     │
│  DELETE    │ Company exits → Archive with proof         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Pricing**: $500/month per regulator

**Upsell**: API access = +$1,000/month

---

### 3. **Law-as-Code Marketplace** (The iTunes Store)
**What it is**: Buy/sell compliance rules.

**Pitch**: "Every law is code. Every code is for sale."

**CRUD Matrix**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  CREATE    │ Write law in Prolog → Publish              │
│  READ      │ Browse laws → Download                     │
│  UPDATE    │ Law changes → Version control              │
│  DELETE    │ Law repealed → Deprecate                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Pricing**: 
- Buyers: $1,000 per law
- Sellers: 70% revenue share (like App Store)

**Upsell**: Custom laws = $10,000 each

---

## The Worldcom Excel Sheet from Hell (Simplified)

### Traditional Compliance (Worldcom-style)
```
Excel Sheet 1: Jurisdictions (500 rows)
  ├─ Excel Sheet 2: Laws per jurisdiction (5,000 rows)
  │   ├─ Excel Sheet 3: Articles per law (50,000 rows)
  │   │   ├─ Excel Sheet 4: Requirements per article (500,000 rows)
  │   │   │   ├─ Excel Sheet 5: Checks per requirement (5M rows)
  │   │   │   │   └─ Excel Sheet 6: Evidence per check (50M rows)
  │   │   │   └─ [HELL CONTINUES...]
```

**Result**: Nobody understands it. Audits take months. Fraud happens.

### Net2B (Jobs-style)
```
One Prolog file per law.
One circuit per compliance check.
One ZK proof per execution.
One dashboard for everything.
```

**Result**: Everyone understands it. Audits take seconds. Fraud is impossible.

## Steve's Simplification Rules

### Rule 1: "One Feature = One Price"
**Bad**: "Compliance platform with features A, B, C, D..."  
**Good**: "Add CCPA compliance: +$500/month"

### Rule 2: "No Excel Sheets"
**Bad**: Complex pricing calculator with 50 variables  
**Good**: Base price + add-ons (like iPhone storage tiers)

### Rule 3: "Make It Obvious"
**Bad**: "Contact sales for pricing"  
**Good**: "$999/month. Add jurisdictions for $500 each."

### Rule 4: "Upsell at Pain Points"
**Bad**: Upsell randomly  
**Good**: 
- Deploy 2nd app → "Need multi-app dashboard? +$500/month"
- Audit coming → "Need instant report? +$500"
- Law changes → "Need auto-update? Upgrade to Pro"

## Steve's Final Words

**"You're not selling compliance. You're selling certainty."**

**"You're not selling software. You're selling sleep."**

**"You're not selling ZK proofs. You're selling 'I told you so' to regulators."**

**"Keep it simple. Make it obvious. Charge what it's worth."**

**"And remember: ZK hackers gotta eat."**
