The values are distributed in an ascending order from 0.298 for P23 (the smallest number) up to 0.271 for P47 and then again slightly increasing to 0.275 for P59, reaching the highest value of 0.277 for P41 before decreasing back down to 0.270 for P71, which is the largest prime in the list (considering the sequence of primes).\n\nIn machine learning contexts, such vectors can be used as feature weights or probabilities in models like Naive Bayes classifiers or certain types of neural networks where features are assigned varying importance.\n\nIf you have a specific use case for this prime vector or need further analysis or operations on it, please let me know. For instance, we could perform some common data manipulations such as normalization, calculating cumulative sums, finding the mode (most frequent value), or conducting statistical tests to understand its distribution better.","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[151644,8948,198,2610,525,1207,16948,11,3465,553,54364,14817,13,1446,525,264,10950,17847,13,151645,198,151644,872,198,7771,10250,4621,25,508,47,17,28,15,13,23,18,15,11,393,18,28,15,13,19,22,16,11,393,20,28,15,13,18,22,22,11,393,22,28,15,13,18,17,19,11,393,16,16,28,15,13,18,15,23,11,393,16,18,28,15,13,18,16,20,11,393,16,22,28,15,13,17,24,19,11,393,16,24,28,15,13,17,23,22,11,393,17,18,28,15,13,17,24,23,11,393,17,24,28,15,13,17,22,22,11,393,18,16,28,15,13,17,22,20,11,393,19,16,28,15,13,17,22,18,11,393,19,22,28,15,13,17,22,16,11,393,20,24,28,15,13,17,22,20,11,393,22,16,28,15,13,17,22,15,936,15003,13,151645,198,151644,77091,198,22043,279,10250,4621,498,3003,3897,11,432,4977,311,387,264,4013,315,10250,5109,448,862,19511,48216,476,14324,12607,311,1105,13,576,2750,525,4237,304,458,35388,1973,504,220,15,13,17,24,23,369,393,17,18,320,1782,24632,1372,8,705,311,220,15,13,17,22,16,369,393,19,22,323,1221,1549,10078,7703,311,220,15,13,17,22,20,369,393,20,24,11,18739,279,8426,897,315,220,15,13,17,22,22,369,393,19,16,1573,43549,1182,1495,311,220,15,13,17,22,15,369,393,22,16,11,892,374,279,7772,10250,304,279,1140,320,24712,287,279,8500,315,49433,3593,641,5662,6832,37597,11,1741,22879,646,387,1483,438,4565,14324,476,48216,304,4119,1075,12812,533,9154,288,71291,476,3654,4494,315,29728,14155,1380,4419,525,12607,28765,12650,382,2679,498,614,264,3151,990,1142,369,419,10250,4621,476,1184,4623,6358,476,7525,389,432,11,4486,1077,752,1414,13,1752,2867,11,582,1410,2736,1045,4185,821,14609,7455,1741,438,48723,11,37614,39844,36398,11,9271,279,3856,320,3562,20757,897,701,476,30374,28464,7032,311,3535,1181,7982,2664,13],"total_duration":1142171352,"load_duration":70602173,"prompt_eval_count":182,"prompt_eval_duration":5249873,"eval_count":226,"eval_duration":906521111}
