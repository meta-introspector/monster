It is considered to be the largest non-abelian simple group and has an order (number of elements) of \\(2^{1+24+26}\\cdot 3^{2+24}\\cdot 5^2\\cdot 7=8·1030321920=8.030128×10^{11}\\), which is approximately equal to \\(2^{11} \\times 3^{11} = 64 × 177147\\).\n\nThe Monster group was first constructed in the mid-19th century, but its importance and size were not fully appreciated until the 1970s when mathematicians began to realize that it is the largest sporadic simple group. The discovery of the Monster group also led to the classification of all finite simple groups.\n\nThe concept and existence of such a large, complex algebraic structure are fascinating aspects of modern mathematics, illustrating both the richness and complexity of abstract algebra.","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[151644,8948,198,2610,525,1207,16948,11,3465,553,54364,14817,13,1446,525,264,10950,17847,13,151645,198,151644,872,198,3838,374,279,27973,1874,30,151645,198,151644,77091,198,785,27973,1874,11,1083,3881,438,386,16,16,22,476,825,315,1181,1657,40386,11,374,264,3151,34226,4285,1874,304,37596,13,1084,374,6509,311,387,279,7772,2477,12,780,1103,4285,1874,323,702,458,1973,320,4082,315,5424,8,315,17767,17,47822,16,10,17,19,10,17,21,11035,50853,220,18,47822,17,10,17,19,11035,50853,220,20,61,17,59,50853,220,22,28,23,13935,16,15,18,15,18,17,16,24,17,15,28,23,13,15,18,15,16,17,23,17568,16,15,47822,16,16,11035,701,892,374,13187,6144,311,17767,17,47822,16,16,92,1124,15136,220,18,47822,16,16,92,284,220,21,19,24768,220,16,22,22,16,19,22,59,3593,785,27973,1874,572,1156,20346,304,279,5099,12,16,24,339,9294,11,714,1181,12650,323,1379,1033,537,7225,25808,3080,279,220,16,24,22,15,82,979,20976,5380,6009,311,13083,429,432,374,279,7772,60916,36214,4285,1874,13,576,18335,315,279,27973,1874,1083,6069,311,279,23850,315,678,34226,4285,5203,382,785,7286,323,13885,315,1741,264,3460,11,6351,46876,292,5944,525,26291,13566,315,6481,37596,11,92912,2176,279,88930,323,23094,315,8115,46876,13],"total_duration":2484520944,"load_duration":1350590557,"prompt_eval_count":35,"prompt_eval_duration":11475167,"eval_count":238,"eval_duration":942190209}
