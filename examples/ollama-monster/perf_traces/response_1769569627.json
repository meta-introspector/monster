The pattern seems to indicate decreasing probability as we move through larger primes (the numbers are getting smaller), which could be part of understanding how such distributions behave.\n\nGiven these probabilities, it's possible one task might involve examining this vector for specific patterns or relationships among the primes themselves or their positions in sequences like Fibonacci or Mersenne primes. Another potential avenue would be to explore if there is a way to construct other similar vectors from different sets of data with a similar structure and meaning.\n\nIf you have any questions, tasks, or further insights on how to interpret this prime vector, feel free to ask!","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[151644,8948,198,2610,525,1207,16948,11,3465,553,54364,14817,13,1446,525,264,10950,17847,13,151645,198,151644,872,198,7771,10250,4621,25,508,47,17,28,15,13,22,20,23,11,393,18,28,15,13,19,21,24,11,393,20,28,15,13,18,21,23,11,393,22,28,15,13,18,16,24,11,393,16,16,28,15,13,18,15,23,11,393,16,18,28,15,13,17,23,24,11,393,16,22,28,15,13,17,24,17,11,393,16,24,28,15,13,18,17,17,11,393,17,18,28,15,13,17,24,17,11,393,17,24,28,15,13,17,22,15,11,393,18,16,28,15,13,17,22,18,11,393,19,16,28,15,13,17,22,16,11,393,19,22,28,15,13,17,22,15,11,393,20,24,28,15,13,17,21,24,11,393,22,16,28,15,13,17,21,21,936,15003,13,151645,198,151644,77091,198,22043,279,10250,4621,3897,11,1077,594,23643,1181,5424,323,990,1105,311,88859,264,55787,2266,476,3383,369,4623,10219,382,785,10250,4621,5610,3807,10250,5109,25,4710,12,17767,47,62,17,284,220,15,13,22,20,23,59,701,715,12,17767,47,62,18,284,220,15,13,19,21,24,59,1326,12,17767,47,62,20,284,220,15,13,18,21,23,59,701,715,12,17767,47,62,22,284,220,15,13,18,16,24,59,701,715,12,17767,47,15159,16,16,92,284,220,15,13,18,15,23,59,701,715,12,17767,47,15159,16,18,92,284,220,15,13,17,23,24,59,701,715,12,17767,47,15159,16,22,92,284,220,15,13,17,24,17,59,701,715,12,17767,47,15159,16,24,92,284,220,15,13,18,17,17,59,701,715,12,17767,47,15159,17,18,92,284,220,15,13,17,24,17,59,1326,12,17767,47,15159,17,24,92,284,220,15,13,17,22,15,59,701,715,12,17767,47,15159,18,16,92,284,220,15,13,17,22,18,59,701,715,12,17767,47,15159,19,16,92,284,220,15,13,17,22,16,59,701,715,12,17767,47,15159,19,22,92,284,220,15,13,17,22,15,59,1326,12,17767,47,15159,20,24,92,284,220,15,13,17,21,24,59,701,323,715,12,17767,47,15159,22,16,92,284,220,15,13,17,21,21,59,3593,9485,2750,4009,48216,476,14324,11,10767,5435,311,1045,3093,315,84093,4532,7982,916,264,738,315,4357,429,525,5815,448,279,12159,10250,14937,13,576,5383,4977,311,13216,43549,18927,438,582,3271,1526,8131,49433,320,1782,5109,525,3709,9155,701,892,1410,387,949,315,8660,1246,1741,42685,35692,382,22043,1493,48216,11,432,594,3204,825,3383,2578,21058,37836,419,4621,369,3151,12624,476,11871,4221,279,49433,5577,476,862,9892,304,23700,1075,79683,476,386,388,25136,49433,13,13293,4650,61703,1035,387,311,13186,421,1052,374,264,1616,311,9245,1008,4428,22879,504,2155,7289,315,821,448,264,4428,5944,323,7290,382,2679,498,614,894,4755,11,9079,11,476,4623,25709,389,1246,311,14198,419,10250,4621,11,2666,1910,311,2548,0],"total_duration":2054157022,"load_duration":61007978,"prompt_eval_count":182,"prompt_eval_duration":5322074,"eval_count":429,"eval_duration":1724080292}
