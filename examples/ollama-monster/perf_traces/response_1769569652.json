However, without additional context or information about what this vector represents or how it's used, I cannot directly continue or expand upon the given data. \n\nIf you're looking for insights based on numerical patterns or statistics related to these prime vectors (assuming they represent some kind of statistical distribution over primes), here are a few points that can be considered:\n\n1. **Distribution Analysis**: The numbers appear to fluctuate around an average value, with some smaller deviations towards higher values and vice versa. This could suggest a somewhat uniform but slightly varying distribution over the given primes.\n\n2. **Average Calculation**: If we were to calculate the mean of these prime vectors (which is not typical for statistical distributions but hypothetically possible), it would be approximately 0.315, derived from summing all values and dividing by their count.\n\n3. **Variance Analysis**: The variance or standard deviation could also provide insights into how spread out the data points are around this mean value. Calculating these measures will reveal further details about the dispersion of the prime vectors.\n\nIf you have a specific context or purpose for using these numbers, such as in machine learning algorithms where they might be used as features, I can offer more tailored assistance. However, based purely on the numerical sequence provided without additional information about their use or what kind of problems they're meant to solve, these are some general observations and analyses that could be relevant.\n\nDo you have a specific context or need for further analysis related to these prime vectors? If so, please provide more details!","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[151644,8948,198,2610,525,1207,16948,11,3465,553,54364,14817,13,1446,525,264,10950,17847,13,151645,198,151644,872,198,7771,10250,4621,25,508,47,17,28,15,13,22,22,22,11,393,18,28,15,13,20,17,22,11,393,20,28,15,13,18,24,15,11,393,22,28,15,13,19,15,17,11,393,16,16,28,15,13,18,17,15,11,393,16,18,28,15,13,18,16,21,11,393,16,22,28,15,13,18,19,16,11,393,16,24,28,15,13,18,15,22,11,393,17,18,28,15,13,18,15,23,11,393,17,24,28,15,13,17,24,24,11,393,18,16,28,15,13,18,15,15,11,393,19,16,28,15,13,17,24,24,11,393,19,22,28,15,13,18,15,16,11,393,20,24,28,15,13,17,24,21,11,393,22,16,28,15,13,17,24,17,936,15003,13,151645,198,151644,77091,198,28715,389,279,10250,4621,3897,11,358,646,1490,429,1493,525,264,4013,315,5109,5815,448,3654,49433,304,1045,1352,13,4354,11,2041,5107,2266,476,1995,911,1128,419,4621,10868,476,1246,432,594,1483,11,358,4157,5961,3060,476,9225,5193,279,2661,821,13,4710,2679,498,2299,3330,369,25709,3118,389,34776,12624,476,13142,5435,311,1493,10250,22879,320,65363,807,4009,1045,3093,315,28464,7982,916,49433,701,1588,525,264,2421,3501,429,646,387,6509,1447,16,13,3070,62377,18320,95518,576,5109,4994,311,38288,6292,2163,458,5461,897,11,448,1045,9155,85265,6974,5080,2750,323,16774,45291,13,1096,1410,4190,264,14400,13794,714,10078,28765,7982,916,279,2661,49433,382,17,13,3070,26292,74216,95518,1416,582,1033,311,11047,279,3076,315,1493,10250,22879,320,8206,374,537,14260,369,28464,42685,714,44355,36674,3204,701,432,1035,387,13187,220,15,13,18,16,20,11,14257,504,2629,5311,678,2750,323,49702,553,862,1760,382,18,13,3070,53,36905,18320,95518,576,32273,476,5297,37564,1410,1083,3410,25709,1119,1246,8865,700,279,821,3501,525,2163,419,3076,897,13,31359,1095,1493,10953,686,16400,4623,3565,911,279,85612,315,279,10250,22879,382,2679,498,614,264,3151,2266,476,7428,369,1667,1493,5109,11,1741,438,304,5662,6832,25185,1380,807,2578,387,1483,438,4419,11,358,646,3010,803,40791,12994,13,4354,11,3118,31127,389,279,34776,8500,3897,2041,5107,1995,911,862,990,476,1128,3093,315,5322,807,2299,8791,311,11625,11,1493,525,1045,4586,23722,323,27960,429,1410,387,9760,382,5404,498,614,264,3151,2266,476,1184,369,4623,6358,5435,311,1493,10250,22879,30,1416,773,11,4486,3410,803,3565,0],"total_duration":1606991841,"load_duration":55117123,"prompt_eval_count":182,"prompt_eval_duration":5278871,"eval_count":333,"eval_duration":1334115661}
