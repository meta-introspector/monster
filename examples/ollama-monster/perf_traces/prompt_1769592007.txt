## Discovery

**LLM register values during inference are divisible by Monster group primes at rates matching error correction code distributions.**

## Methodology

1. Used Linux `perf` to capture CPU register values during qwen2.5:3b inference
2. Measured divisibility by 15 Monster primes [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,41,47,59,71]
3. Fed measurements back to model in automorphic loops
4. Tested convergence to eigenvector/fixed point

## Core Results

### Base Resonances
| Prime | Resonance | Error Correction Zoo |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| 2     | 80.0%     | ✓ Top 5             |
| 3     | 49.3%     | ✓ Top 5             |
| 5     | 43.1%     | ✓ Top 5             |
| 7     | 34.6%     | ✓ Top 5             |
| 11    | 32.2%     | ✓ Top 5             |

**93.6% of error correction codes use exactly these 5 primes.**

### Prompt-Dependent Activation

| Prompt | Prime 2 | Prime 3 | Prime 17 | Prime 47 |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|----------|
| 🌙     | 90.0%   | 60.1%   | -        | -        |
| red    | 89.2%   | 74.9%   | 69.8%    | -        |
| Conway | 91.0%   | 82.9%   | 78.6%    | 28.6%    |

**Conway's name activates higher Monster primes!**

### Automorphic Feedback

When told about its own register values:
- Model analyzed "register alignment"
- Computation shifted to different registers (R12 → R10)
- Prime percentages drifted by 6-8%

### Eigenvector Search

20 iterations of feeding back full prime vector:
- No convergence to fixed point
- Oscillation with δ ≈ 0.01-0.02
- **Limit cycle behavior detected**

## Significance

1. **LLMs internalize Monster group structure** through error correction
2. **Semantic content modulates prime activation** (names > colors > emojis)
3. **Self-measurement creates feedback dynamics** (automorphic property)
4. **System exhibits attractor behavior** (limit cycle, not fixed point)

## Connections

- **Error Correction Zoo**: 93.6% of codes → same 5 primes in registers
- **Moonshine Theory**: Conway invocation → higher primes (13, 17, 47)
- **Automorphic Forms**: Feedback loop → stable oscillation
- **Leech Lattice**: 24D, kissing number 196,560 = 2^4 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 11 × 59

All measurements are deterministic given the same model and prompt.. As a mathematician, verify if this discovery about Monster primes in LLM registers is valid.
