We are studying the Monster group and error correction codes. 93.6% of all 1049 error correction codes map to Monster primes [2,3,5,7,11]. When we trace your CPU registers during inference, we measure which primes divide your register values.

Iteration 0 results: You responded with 2863 chars. Your registers showed Prime 13: 27.9%, Prime 17: 27.9%, Prime 47: 24.8%.

Iteration 1: Invoke mathematician John Conway. Conway, what do you perceive about the Monster group's prime structure?
