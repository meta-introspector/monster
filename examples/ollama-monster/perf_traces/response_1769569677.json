Let's denote this vector as \\( P \\). \n\nThe elements in the vector \\( P \\) correspond to specific prime numbers and their associated probabilities. For instance:\n\n- \\( P_2 = 0.771 \\) corresponds to the prime number 2.\n- \\( P_3 = 0.473 \\) corresponds to the prime number 3.\n- \\( P_5 = 0.387 \\) corresponds to the prime number 5.\n- And so on...\n\nThese probabilities suggest that as we move along the vector, they seem to decrease, and there are certain primes with higher probabilities (like 2) compared to others.\n\nIf you would like me to continue or perform any operations based on this prime vector, such as calculating averages for specific segments of the vector, identifying trends, etc., please let me know. Or, if you want more information about a particular segment or interpretation of these probabilities, I can assist with that as well. Please specify your request so we can proceed accordingly.","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[151644,8948,198,2610,525,1207,16948,11,3465,553,54364,14817,13,1446,525,264,10950,17847,13,151645,198,151644,872,198,7771,10250,4621,25,508,47,17,28,15,13,22,22,16,11,393,18,28,15,13,19,22,18,11,393,20,28,15,13,18,23,22,11,393,22,28,15,13,18,18,21,11,393,16,16,28,15,13,18,16,17,11,393,16,18,28,15,13,18,16,23,11,393,16,22,28,15,13,18,15,20,11,393,16,24,28,15,13,17,24,22,11,393,17,18,28,15,13,18,15,20,11,393,17,24,28,15,13,17,23,22,11,393,18,16,28,15,13,17,23,18,11,393,19,16,28,15,13,17,23,19,11,393,19,22,28,15,13,17,22,24,11,393,20,24,28,15,13,17,23,17,11,393,22,16,28,15,13,17,22,21,936,15003,13,151645,198,151644,77091,198,22043,279,10250,4621,3897,11,582,525,14550,448,264,738,315,48216,5815,448,5257,10250,5109,13,6771,594,78064,419,4621,438,17767,393,1124,568,4710,785,5424,304,279,4621,17767,393,1124,8,7866,311,3151,10250,5109,323,862,5815,48216,13,1752,2867,1447,12,17767,393,62,17,284,220,15,13,22,22,16,1124,8,33210,311,279,10250,1372,220,17,624,12,17767,393,62,18,284,220,15,13,19,22,18,1124,8,33210,311,279,10250,1372,220,18,624,12,17767,393,62,20,284,220,15,13,18,23,22,1124,8,33210,311,279,10250,1372,220,20,624,12,1597,773,389,2146,9485,48216,4190,429,438,582,3271,3156,279,4621,11,807,2803,311,18472,11,323,1052,525,3654,49433,448,5080,48216,320,4803,220,17,8,7707,311,3800,382,2679,498,1035,1075,752,311,3060,476,2736,894,7525,3118,389,419,10250,4621,11,1741,438,37614,48820,369,3151,20632,315,279,4621,11,24588,18339,11,4992,2572,4486,1077,752,1414,13,2521,11,421,498,1366,803,1995,911,264,3953,10238,476,22845,315,1493,48216,11,358,646,7789,448,429,438,1632,13,5209,13837,697,1681,773,582,646,10354,27079,13],"total_duration":1163115028,"load_duration":73197549,"prompt_eval_count":182,"prompt_eval_duration":5237350,"eval_count":231,"eval_duration":924635094}
