# Hecke Operators at Multiple Scales

## Summary

- Shards analyzed: 15
- Chunks analyzed: 50
- Neurons analyzed: 30
- Self-similarity: 100.0%

## Modular Property

Hecke operators compose multiplicatively at ALL scales:
T_model = ∏ T_shard
T_shard = ∏ T_chunk
T_chunk = ∏ T_neuron

Like j-invariant modular transformations:
j(γτ) = j(τ) for γ ∈ SL(2,ℤ)
T(composed) = T₁ × T₂ for all scales
