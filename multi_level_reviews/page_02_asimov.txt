# Asimov Inspiration - Page 02

**Focus**: Foundation, psychohistory, logic, prediction

 The image you've provided appears to be a screenshot of a document or manual page that lists "Foundation Principles" along with their associated numbers and descriptions. In terms of psychohistory, which is the field of study Isaac Asimov was well-known for, it involves the application of mathematical methods to predict future events based on human behavior. The "Foundation Principles" mentioned here are likely from Asimov's works, specifically referencing his science fiction series "The Foundation Trilogy."

From what is visible in the image, there are seven principles listed:

1. **Stability** – 1 point
2. **Non-Violence** – 2 points
3. **Anti-Imperialism** – 3 points
4. **Inertia** – 4 points
5. **Psychohistory** – 5 points
6. **Anti-Mathematics** – 1 point
7. **Anarcho-Syndicalism** – 0 points

These principles are core tenets of the fictional Foundation society established by Hari Seldon in the series, which aims to maintain social order and prevent a future where the Galactic Empire would return. The "Foundation Trilogy" explores the complex interactions between these principles as they relate to the broader context of the galactic empire, technology, and human behavior.

The image also shows that there are some actions associated with each principle:

1. **Stability** – 1 point for maintaining stability
2. **Non-Violence** – 2 points for non-violent actions
3. **Anti-Imperialism** – 3 points for anti-imperialistic actions
4. **Inertia** – 4 points for inertial actions
5. **Psychohistory** – 5 points for psychohistorical actions
6. **Anti-Mathematics** – 1 point for anti-mathematical actions
7. **Anarcho-Syndicalism** – 0 points for anarcho-syndicalist actions

In the context of psychohistory, these principles and their actions can be used to predict future events if they are followed or if they are known with certainty. However, it is important to note that this is a fictional construct within a work of science fiction, and while it may make for an interesting thought experiment or simulation, it does not reflect real-world psychohistorical applications.

In summary, the principles listed in the image are related to Asimov's "Foundation Trilogy" and would play a key role in understanding the fictional society's dynamics within the context of the series. While they may provide an interesting framework for predicting future events in a fictional universe, they do not have any real-world applicability or predictive value outside of their fictional setting.
