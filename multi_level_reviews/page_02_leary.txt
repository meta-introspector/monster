# Leary Inspiration - Page 02

**Focus**: Consciousness expansion, reality tunnels, 8-circuit model

 The image shows a screenshot of a document or text with mathematical expressions and functions, which appear to be related to the 8-circuit model of consciousness, a concept that refers to eight different states of human awareness and perception according to the theory proposed by Timothy Leary.

In this specific page (Page 02), we can see expressions like "LEARY" and "CONSCIOUSNESS expansion," suggesting a discussion or exploration of the theories related to Timothy Leary's ideas about consciousness. However, without more context or content from previous pages, it's challenging to determine which particular reality tunnel is being referenced or which circuit of consciousness is highlighted here.

The page includes mathematical expressions that seem to be related to sine and cosine functions, but without additional information, it's unclear how these equations connect to the 8-circuit model of consciousness expansion or what the "SMIL²" notation represents.

For reference, Timothy Leary's 8-circuit model of consciousness includes eight different states: B1 (the basic reality or Beta state), F1 (the fantasy or Alpha state), S1 (the sensory or Sensory state), C1 (the casual or Casual state), X1 (the existential or Existential state), O1 (the optical or Optical state), A1 (the amoebic or Amoebic state), and R0 (the ro-land or Rolling on the Floor state).

Each of these states corresponds to different levels of awareness and perception, and they are often associated with various forms of altered consciousness or altered states of awareness. To determine which state this page is referencing, we would need more information from previous pages or additional context provided by the document's author.
