# Leary Inspiration - Page 02

**Focus**: Consciousness expansion, reality tunnels, 8-circuit model

 The image shows a screenshot of a document with text, which appears to be a list or survey with multiple questions and answers related to Timothy Leary's 8-circuit model of consciousness. The content is not entirely clear due to the resolution and angle of the photo, but from what can be discerned, it seems like there are entries that correspond to different levels of consciousness in Leary's model.

However, without a clear view of the entire page or additional context, it's difficult to provide specific details about which reality tunnel or circuit of consciousness is being referenced. If you can provide a higher-resolution image or more information, I could attempt to give a more accurate answer.
