# Group_Theorist Review - Page 03

**Focus**: Group theory correctness, Monster group properties, representation theory

 The image displays a screenshot of a webpage with a list titled "Page 03 - GROUP_THEORIST (scholar)." This list seems to be part of an educational or academic resource, possibly related to group theory, specifically sporadic groups and their properties. The items on the list include:

1) Monster group properties:
   - Linear monsters: "26,248,"
   - Non-elementary monsters: "58,43,192,"
   - Exceptional 2-groups: "41,48,208,"
   - Monster groups in GAP.

2) Representation accuracy:
   - "26,248" is written twice, which may be an error or oversight in the list.

3) Modular forms:
   - No specific mention of modular forms is noted on the page, so it's unclear if there are any relevant details about modular forms missing from the list or they are not part of this section.

4) J-invariant usage:
   - The term "J-invariant" is mentioned without further explanation, which would be necessary for understanding how it is used in this context. It may refer to an element or concept within group theory that is relevant to the monster group, such as the J-invariant of a projective representation in the context of the Monster group.

The list is presented in a simple text format and does not include any images or diagrams that might be used to visually represent the concepts being discussed. The webpage appears to be educational or informational, likely intended for scholars or students studying sporadic groups and related topics.
