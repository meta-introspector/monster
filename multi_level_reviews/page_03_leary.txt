# Leary Inspiration - Page 03

**Focus**: Consciousness expansion, reality tunnels, 8-circuit model

 The image shows a list that appears to be related to the 8-circuit model, which is associated with Timothy Leary's work on psychedelic consciousness expansion. The circuits mentioned in the list are:

1. Biology and Body - This refers to the biological and physical aspects of our bodies and how they influence our perception of reality.
2. Emotion - The emotional state and feelings we have, which can shape our experiences within a reality tunnel.
3. Mind Designer - Suggests a focus on designing one's own mind through various means, possibly including meditation, spiritual practices, or intellectual pursuits.
4. Electronics - Refers to the use of technology and electronic devices in expanding one's consciousness or understanding of reality.
5. Social Interactions - The social aspects of our lives, including relationships and interactions with others, which can have a profound impact on our perceptions.
6. Cultural Artifacts - This likely refers to cultural symbols, beliefs, and art that can influence our understanding of reality.
7. Myths and Metaphors - The stories, symbols, and narratives that are shared within cultures and can shape how we interpret the world around us.
8. Inner Space/Technology - This could be a combination of inner exploration and the use of technology to enhance one's connection with reality or consciousness.

The phrase "SMI²LE!" is also present, which could be a typo or an abbreviation for something else, but its context in this list is not clear.

Without additional information, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of the document or the purpose behind the list. It seems to be encouraging exploration and expansion of one's understanding of reality through various avenues related to Timothy Leary's model of consciousness.
