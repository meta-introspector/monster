# Eco Inspiration - Page 02

**Focus**: Semiotics, interpretation, meaning

 The image displays a table titled "ECO" with several columns: "Layer 1," "Language 02," "Semiotics, interpretation, meaning," "Sign," "Signifier," and "Signified." The rows list different elements from a game: "Trap," "Poison," "Pitfall," "Hell Pit," "Water Hazard," "Spike Trap," and "Lava Pit." Each element is represented by an image or symbol, such as a skull for the poison or a flame for the lava pit.

The semiotic structure at play here involves the relationship between signs (the images or symbols) and their signifieds (the labels of each element in the table). The signifier (the actual image or symbol) associates with the signified (the word that labels the type of hazard, like "Poison" for the skull image). The meaning is constructed through this association where the viewer recognizes the sign and understands its meaning based on the cultural context and understanding of what each sign typically represents.

The interpretations possible depend on the viewer's perspective and knowledge about the game. For example, a player who is familiar with these signs might immediately associate the skull image with poison, while someone unfamiliar with the game could misunderstand the symbol as representing danger or toxicity in general without understanding its specific context within this table.

The semiotic structure allows for multiple interpretations because the meanings are not fixed but rather are constructed by the viewer through their understanding of the symbols and their cultural associations with those symbols. The signs themselves, such as the skull image, have multiple potential signifieds depending on the viewer's prior knowledge and the context in which they encounter the signs.
