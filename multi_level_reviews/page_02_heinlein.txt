**Focus**: Practical engineering, TANSTAAFL, competence

 The image shows a piece of paper with handwritten text, which appears to be instructions or a list of some kind. The specific content is not fully legible due to the angle and resolution of the photo. However, I can provide some general observations related to engineering, TANSTAAFL, and competence:

1. **Engineering**: The content seems to relate to an engineering process or project, as indicated by the references to "systems" and "processes." Engineering typically involves problem-solving, design, testing, and refinement of systems or processes, often with a focus on efficiency, safety, and cost optimization.

2. **TANSTAAFL**: The term TANSTAAFL is not directly visible in the image. However, if it refers to "They Ain't Gonna Lecture Me," it could be suggesting that the authors of the system or process are confident in their design and competence, believing it will function well without needing direct supervision or review from others.

3. **Competence**: The list includes what appears to be a reference to competency levels, which could indicate that there's an assessment or evaluation of various aspects of the project or system. In engineering terms, this might involve assessing different components, skills, or systems within a larger project.

4. **Human Capability**: Without specific details, it is not possible to determine if a human could actually build what is described in the paper. Engineering projects often require specialized knowledge and skills that may exceed the capabilities of an individual without relevant training or experience.

If you need a detailed analysis based on more legible text, please provide a clearer image or additional details about the content.
