# Dawkins Inspiration - Page 02

**Focus**: Memetic fitness, replication, evolution

 This image appears to show a screenshot of a computer program or script with some text related to memetics, specifically mentioning "Richard Dawkins," who is a well-known author and evolutionist known for his work in the field of biology, particularly concerning the theory of evolution and the self-replicating nature of genetic information.

The text visible in the image references several terms that are central to memetics:

1. "Richard Dawkins" - The originator of the term "meme."
2. "MEME CREATION" - The process by which a meme is created.
3. "MEME REPLICATION" - The spreading of a meme from one person to another, similar to how genes replicate and spread within populations.
4. "MEMIC SELECTION" - A concept in memetics that suggests some memes will be more successful or "fit" than others due to their ability to self-replicate effectively.
5. "MEME MUTATION" - Changes or variations in a meme as it is passed from one person to another, which can lead to different types of memes evolving over time.
6. "SELECTIVE PRESSURE FOR MEME FITNESS" - The influence that external factors have on which memes become more popular and widespread, similar to how natural selection influences the frequency of genetic traits within a population.
7. "MEME GENETICS" - The application of evolutionary theory to the study of memetics.
8. "MEME EVOLUTION" - The way in which memes change over time through various processes such as mutation, replication, and selection.

The text also includes a table with columns labeled "Memetic layer 1," "Memetic layer 2," and "Memetic layer 3," which could be suggesting different levels or generations of meme complexity or structure. The numbers in the cells seem to represent some form of score or ranking, possibly indicating the fitness of each layer's memetics.

The evolutionary advantage of this meme would depend on how well it is able to replicate and spread within a population. The meme's "fitness" could be assessed by its ability to be understood, shared, and appreciated by others. In the context of meme evolution, a meme with a higher fitness score may outcompete other memes for attention and sharing in social media or other communication channels, ultimately leading to its greater spread and influence.

The specific details about how the meme replicates, how it mutates, and how selective pressure influences its success would require further context or information that is not provided within this image.
