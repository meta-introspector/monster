# Leary Inspiration - Page 01

**Focus**: Consciousness expansion, reality tunnels, 8-circuit model

 The image appears to be a screenshot of an email or document titled "MONSTER GROUP - FAMILY CONSULTATION - A SOLUTION TO THE STRESS OF ADHD." It seems to be discussing a solution for managing the stress related to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

Regarding your question, since this is not directly related to Timothy Leary or his 8-circuit model of consciousness, it's difficult to make connections from the content of the image. If you have any specific questions about the text on the page and how it relates to Leary's work, I can provide information based on that context. Otherwise, the document is discussing a solution to stress for families with ADHD children, which is not directly related to Leary's model or his work in consciousness expansion and reality tunnels.
