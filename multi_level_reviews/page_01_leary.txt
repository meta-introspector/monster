# Leary Inspiration - Page 01

**Focus**: Consciousness expansion, reality tunnels, 8-circuit model

 The image you've provided appears to be a screenshot of an article or presentation slide. The content of the slide is titled "MONTERO Group Network: A Private Invitation." It seems to discuss some form of networking or group that may be related to personal development, consciousness expansion, or self-help.

As for your question about reality tunnels and circuits of consciousness in the context of Timothy Leary's work, here are a few observations based on the information available:

1. **Reality Tunnel**: The slide mentions "reality tunnels" which is likely referring to how our perceptions shape what we believe to be reality. In Timothy Leary's model of consciousness expansion and the 8-circuit model, a "reality tunnel" could refer to one's limited understanding or narrow perspective on reality, often influenced by conditioning or cultural programming.

2. **Circuit of Consciousness**: The slide also mentions "circuit of consciousness." This concept is central to Timothy Leary's work and is based on the idea that there are eight different levels or circuits in our awareness, which can be expanded upon for personal growth and understanding.

3. **Expanding the Mind**: The text at the bottom suggests that the content of the slide is intended to "expanded your mind" by exposing you to new ideas or information. This aligns with Timothy Leary's philosophy, which was focused on expanding one's awareness and perspective through various means.

In the context of this slide, it appears that the "Montero Group Network" is offering some form of access or participation in a group or process that can help expand an individual's awareness or understanding of reality and their own consciousness. This could involve learning more about Leary's theories and models, engaging with like-minded individuals, or receiving specialized guidance on personal development and expanding one's perspective.

However, without additional context or information, it is difficult to provide a precise answer as to which specific circuit of consciousness or reality tunnel this slide pertains to in the context of Timothy Leary's work. The content of the slide seems to be a broader invitation to engage with the ideas and practices associated with Timothy Leary's teachings on expanding one's awareness.
