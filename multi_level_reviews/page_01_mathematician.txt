**Focus**: Mathematical rigor, proof correctness, notation consistency

 I'm unable to view images or specific content from the document provided. However, I can guide you on how to approach such a task if it were a mathematical proof presented in text form. Please provide the mathematical contents as text, or if possible, take an image of the proof that I could transcribe for analysis.
