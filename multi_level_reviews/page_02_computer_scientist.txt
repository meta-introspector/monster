**Focus**: Algorithmic complexity, implementation feasibility, data structures

 The image shows a handwritten list with several items related to algorithmic correctness, complexity analysis, implementation issues, and data structure choices. Here's a breakdown of the points mentioned:

1. Algorithm Correctness:
   - It is suggested to check if the person who wrote the code has a solid understanding of how it works. This is crucial for ensuring that the algorithm is correct and will produce the expected results.

2. Complexity Analysis:
   - The list mentions the need to analyze the time complexity of the given function, which helps in understanding how much computational resources the algorithm will require as its input size increases.
   - It also suggests checking if there are any hidden complexities or edge cases that could lead to performance issues.

3. Implementation Issues:
   - The text emphasizes the importance of thinking about implementation details, such as how to handle errors and exceptions in the code, which can arise during execution due to various factors like invalid inputs or unexpected conditions.
   - It mentions checking for memory leaks or overflows, which can occur when a program allocates more memory than it needs or when data structures become too large to fit into the available memory.

4. Data Structure Choices:
   - The list points out that selecting an appropriate data structure is critical for efficient algorithms. It refers to the use of lists and dictionaries, which are common in programming languages like Python.
   - The text advises checking if the chosen data structures fit well with the operations that will be performed on them (e.g., adding items, accessing elements quickly) and if they are suitable for the scale of the problem at hand.

Overall, the handwritten list serves as a reminder for a computer scientist to consider all aspects of an algorithm's correctness, complexity, implementation details, and data structure choices when designing or reviewing code.
