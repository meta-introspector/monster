# Mathematician Review - Page 03

**Focus**: Mathematical rigor, proof correctness, notation consistency

 As an AI, I cannot directly view images or text within them. However, if you could provide the text from the image, I can review it based on your specifications:

1) Proof correctness: To ensure proof correctness, we should check that the steps in the proof are valid and that all assumptions and theorems used have been stated and proven correctly. Please provide the text or context for the proof you wish to evaluate.

2) Notation consistency: I can only provide a generic review without specific notation details from the image. However, it's important to ensure that all notation used is consistent throughout the document, including any mathematical symbols, variables, functions, and sets. For example, if the author uses set-builder notation consistently for intervals or other mathematical structures, or if the notation for theorems and proofs is in line with standard mathematical conventions.

3) Missing lemmas: To identify missing lemmas, we would need to know what the content of the page is about and whether there are any unstated assumptions that are needed for the proof to be valid. I could review this if you provide the text from the image.

4) Logical gaps: A logical gap occurs where a step in the proof is missing or not clearly stated, leading to an incorrect conclusion. We would need the specific context and steps within the proof to identify such gaps. If you provide the text or context for the proof, I can review it for any potential logical gaps.
