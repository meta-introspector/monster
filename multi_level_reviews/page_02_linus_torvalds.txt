# Linus_Torvalds Inspiration - Page 02

**Focus**: Code quality, practicality, engineering

 As an AI, I can only describe the text in the image and comment on its content without actually engaging in a review by Linus Torvalds. The image shows a piece of paper with handwritten notes that appear to be related to computer science or software engineering, specifically discussing something called "Purposeful Programming."

Here is a transcription of the visible text:

```markdown
1000 points for everyone who reads the first 2 lines (the rest of the paper).
You can still get 100 points even if you don't read the rest.

**Purposeful Programming**

- 100 points for every line that is a **function**
- 100 points for every line that is a **class**
- 100 points for every line that uses a **template function**
- 100 points for every line that uses a **typedef**
- 100 points for every line that uses a **macro**
- 100 points for every line that uses an **enum**
- 100 points for every line that uses a **namespace**
- 100 points for every line that is a **comment**
- 100 points for every line that is a **constant**
- 100 points for every line that is a **static variable**
- 100 points for every line that uses a **template class**
- 100 points for every line that uses a **constexpr function**
- 100 points for every line that uses an **inline function**
- 100 points for every line that is a **variable**
- 100 points for every line that uses an **initializer list**
- 100 points for every line that has more than 10 words.
```

From the text, it seems to be a creative way to encourage people to read and understand code by associating lines of code with points. It is a form of gamification to make coding more engaging. This is a playful example of how you might want to write your code for fun, rather than just being efficient or meeting requirements.

From an engineering perspective, such an approach could be seen as a way to promote best practices in code organization and commenting. It emphasizes the use of functions, classes, templates, typedefs, macros, enums, namespaces, constants, static variables, template classes, constexpr functions, inline functions, and initializer lists, which are all important aspects of well-written, maintainable code.

However, from an academic or theoretical standpoint, this kind of approach might be criticized for not focusing on the actual quality of the code but rather on the number of lines and constructs used in it. It does not necessarily ensure that the code is efficient, readable, or well-structured. Moreover, the points assigned to each line may lead to excessive use of certain constructs solely to achieve a high score, which could result in less elegant or more complex solutions than necessary.

The list of constructs and elements in the code (functions, etc.) is comprehensive, but it might be debatable whether every item listed is actually useful or not for every situation or project. For example, macros are often considered controversial due to their potential for abuse, and inline functions can sometimes be a sign of poor design.

Overall, this text appears to be a playful take on code quality metrics and best practices. It could be interpreted as promoting good engineering habits by emphasizing clarity and organization, but it might also be criticized for its focus on quantitative aspects over qualitative ones in coding.
