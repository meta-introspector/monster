**Focus**: Neural network architecture, training, generalization

 The image shows a document or presentation slide titled "Monster Cognitive Network - A brief." It appears to be related to a research project in the field of artificial intelligence, specifically focusing on neural networks within cognitive computing systems. Here are my comments addressing the points you've requested:

1) Architecture design: The slide references the development of Monster Cognitive Networks for image analysis tasks. However, without more detailed information on the network architecture, it's challenging to review its design in depth. It seems to be a high-level overview rather than providing specific details about layers, units, and connections within the network.

2) Training feasibility: The slide mentions that an experiment was conducted with the Monster Cognitive Network for image analysis tasks. However, it doesn't provide information about the training data set, the performance metrics used (such as accuracy, precision, recall), or the training algorithm employed. Without these details, it's difficult to evaluate the feasibility of training this network.

3) Generalization: The slide does not mention any experiments or results related to generalization, which refers to how well a model can perform on unseen data after being trained on a separate set. To review the generalization capability of the Monster Cognitive Network, additional information would be needed that describes the testing setup and performance metrics.

4) Comparison with existing work: The slide does not compare the Monster Cognitive Network with other neural network architectures or cognitive computing systems. To conduct a thorough review on this point, more information about the comparison criteria and the results of such a comparison would be required.

In summary, while the slide provides a general idea of a research project in neural networks for cognitive computing, it lacks specific details that are needed to evaluate its architecture design, training feasibility, generalization capabilities, and comparison with existing work.
