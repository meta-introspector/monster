**Focus**: Triadic semiotics, pragmatism, logic

 In the image provided, it appears to be a table from the textbook "Muse" by Donald M. Forsdyke, which seems to discuss Peirce's theory of semiotics, specifically focusing on pragmatism and logic. The table itself is broken down into three main parts: Symbol, Icon, and Index, each representing a different type of sign according to Peirce's classification. Here's an analysis based on the information presented in the image:

1. **Symbol (Column 0):** These are signs that have no natural connection with their referent but are chosen arbitrarily for convenience or convention. In this context, the "Symbol" column seems to contain arbitrary values assigned to different levels of a categorical system, such as "Level 1," "Level 2," and so on, up to "Level 35." The pragmatic meaning here would be determined by the rules or conventions that have been established for this particular system.

2. **Icon (Column 1):** These signs resemble their referents in some way. In the image, "Icon" refers to a type of categorical relation called "iconic," which is not directly visible from the table. The pragmatic meaning would depend on how the concept of "iconicity" applies within this context, but generally, it suggests that there is some resemblance or relationship between the sign and its referent that is immediately recognizable to the observer.

3. **Index (Column 2):** These signs are connected to their referents through an associative connection that requires a specific set of circumstances for interpretation. The "Index" column lists various indices: "Symbol," "Number," "Letter," "Class," and so on, up to "Type." Each index represents a different attribute or feature associated with the categorical system. The pragmatic meaning would depend on how these indices are defined and interpreted within the given system.

The pragmatic aspect of Peirce's semiotics, as shown in this image, is concerned with understanding the role of signs in communication and thought, including their conventions, their contextual relationships, and the interpretations that are derived from them. The table demonstrates how various types of signs can be categorized within a system and how they contribute to the construction of meaning in such a system. The pragmatic meaning arises from the way these signs are used and understood within that particular context or category hierarchy.
