**Focus**: Neural network architecture, training, generalization

 The image displays a screenshot of a document, which appears to be a page from an academic paper or research article related to machine learning (ML). Here is the review for each section as it pertains to the visible content:

1) Architecture design:
   - The architecture is described with mathematical notation and pseudo-code. It includes various layers such as convolutional, batch normalization, activation functions like Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), and dropout layers.
   - There's mention of pooling operations which are common in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for dimensionality reduction.
   - The design includes both a classification part and an object detection part, indicating that the model is used for multi-task learning.
   - It also mentions "focal loss," which is a type of loss function often used in semantic segmentation tasks to help the model focus on classes that are difficult to classify.

2) Training feasibility:
   - There's no explicit description of training details, such as learning rate scheduling or optimization algorithm (e.g., Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adam), which are crucial for evaluating training feasibility.
   - The image does not provide information about the size and shape of the dataset used for training, the number of epochs, batch size, or any other parameters that would allow for an assessment of training feasibility.

3) Generalization:
   - The document mentions the use of dropout regularization to prevent overfitting, which is a common technique in deep learning to improve generalization by reducing dependence on individual weights within a network.
   - The presence of focal loss suggests that the authors consider the issue of class imbalance, as it focuses more on learning from minority classes during training.
   - There's no discussion or mention of other methods for improving generalization, such as data augmentation, early stopping, or weight pruning.

4) Comparison with existing work:
   - The text refers to "a comparison with existing works," but the specific details about these comparisons are not visible in the image. It's unclear which works they are referring to and how they compare their proposed method with these references.
