**Focus**: Neural network architecture, training, generalization

 The image you've provided appears to be a screenshot of a document or a webpage with text that seems to be related to machine learning research, specifically concerning a neural network architecture, training, generalization, and comparison with existing work in the field. Here are my observations based on the visible content:

1) Architecture design: The document references "CNN" which stands for Convolutional Neural Networks, suggesting that the architecture discussed here may involve layers inspired by CNNs. However, without more context or a clearer view of the image, it's not possible to provide specific details about the architecture beyond the mention of CNN layers.

2) Training feasibility: The text mentions "50 epoch" and "100 epoch", which refers to the number of training iterations for the neural network. This suggests that the researcher is considering how many iterations it might take for the model to converge during training. Without more details, it's not possible to assess if 50 or 100 epochs is feasible or appropriate for this particular architecture.

3) Generalization: The text mentions "generalization" but does not provide specific details about how generalization is addressed in the proposed model. In machine learning models, generalization refers to the ability of a model to perform well on unseen data. This can be achieved through techniques such as regularization, dropout, and appropriate choice of architecture.

4) Comparison with existing work: The document mentions "comparison" but does not provide specifics about what models or works are being compared to in the context of this research. To make a meaningful comparison, one would need to know the context of the research, such as the specific task or dataset that is being addressed.

Without more information or a clearer view of the document, it's not possible to provide a detailed analysis of these points. However, from what can be discerned, the document seems to be in the early stages of outlining a research project focused on evaluating and improving neural network models for a specific task or application.
