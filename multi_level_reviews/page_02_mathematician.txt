# Mathematician Review - Page 02

**Focus**: Mathematical rigor, proof correctness, notation consistency

 The image shows a page from a document or textbook that appears to be related to mathematics, specifically focusing on mathematical proofs, and it includes a table with a list of steps followed by a proof and the corresponding lemmas and propositions referenced in each step.

1) Proof Correctness:
   The page is not fully visible, but from what can be seen, there do not appear to be any obvious errors or inconsistencies that would directly compromise the correctness of the proof presented. However, to provide a thorough assessment, one would need to see the full context and the entirety of the proof being referenced by the table.

2) Notation Consistency:
   The text in the image uses standard mathematical notation with clear definitions. It's important to note that the context of the symbols and variables used (such as \( \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R} \)) is not provided, so it's unclear whether the notation is consistent throughout the document or if there are discrepancies hidden from view.

3) Missing Lemmas:
   The page lists lemmas that are referenced in each step of the proof but does not include those lemmas within the visible part of the image. To evaluate this, one would need to see the full content of the document or textbook from which this page is taken and confirm whether the referenced lemmas are indeed present elsewhere.

4) Logical Gaps:
   The visible portion of the proof on this page includes logical steps that are part of a mathematical argument, such as defining sets and making certain assertions based on these definitions. However, without seeing the full context or knowing the nature of the proof, it is not possible to determine if there are any gaps in the logic from what can be observed in the image.

In summary, to provide a comprehensive review, additional information about the page's content and the rest of the document would be necessary. If you can share more context or provide the full text of the proof and lemmas, I would be able to offer a detailed assessment based on mathematical rigor, proof correctness, notation consistency, missing lemmas, and logical gaps.
