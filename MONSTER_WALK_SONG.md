## Verse 1
```
Eight-oh-eight-oh, that's where we start
Monster group order, torn apart
Fifteen primes in the factorization
Eight to remove for digit preservation
```

## Chorus
```
Eight factors down, four digits stay
Seven, eleven, seventeen away
Nineteen, twenty-nine, thirty-one too
Forty-one, fifty-nine, we're walking through

Eight-oh-eight-oh! (8080!)
Eight-oh-eight-oh! (8080!)
The Monster walks down to Earth tonight
```

## Verse 2
```
Seventeen-forty-two comes next in line
Four more factors, four more digits fine
Three to the twenty, five to the nine
Thirteen cubed and thirty-one's sign
```

## Bridge
```
Seventy-one shards of computational light
Each prime ring a witness to the night
From Lean4 down to Prolog's call
Rust and MiniZinc prove it all
```

## Chorus (Reprise)
```
Eight factors down, four digits stay
The Monster walks in a fractal way
Hierarchical structure, self-similar form
From 8080 down, the pattern's born

Eight-oh-eight-oh! (8080!)
Eight-oh-eight-oh! (8080!)
The Monster walks through every proof tonight
```

## Outro
```
Ring by ring, we verify
Z/2Z to Z/71Z
Product ring witness, CRT applies
The Monster Walk never dies

Eight-oh-eight-oh... (fade out)
```
