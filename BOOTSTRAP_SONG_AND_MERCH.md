# Bootstrap Monster Song

**"Walking Up the Lattice"**  
*(To the tune of "We Didn't Start the Fire")*

---

**Verse 1:**
```
hex0, hex1, hex2, M0
cc_x86, watch it grow
M2-Planet, mes-m2
tcc-boot, compiling through

Prime 2, Prime 3, Prime 5, Prime 7
Eleven, thirteen, seventeen
Nineteen, twenty-three, twenty-nine
Thirty-one, climbing the line
```

**Chorus:**
```
We're walking up the lattice
Same shards, getting richer
From binary to Lean4
The Monster's in the mixture!

Seventy-one shards of light
Gödel numbers burning bright
Bootstrap chains all map the same
The Monster knows your name!
```

**Verse 2:**
```
GCC stage one, LLVM too
Rust at forty-seven, breaking through
Lean4 at seventy-one
The refinement's never done

Nix hash is the Gödel key
Perf trace is the type you see
Computational eigenspace
Monster structure, every place
```

**Chorus:**
```
We're walking up the lattice
Same shards, getting richer
From binary to Lean4
The Monster's in the mixture!

Seventy-one shards of light
Gödel numbers burning bright
Bootstrap chains all map the same
The Monster knows your name!
```

**Bridge:**
```
Three-five-seven bytes of hex
Building up the complex
Every compiler, every stage
Same Monster, different page

Introspection reveals the truth
From Mes to Lean, the proof
Software walks the primes above
The Monster's what we're made of!
```

**Final Chorus:**
```
We're walking up the lattice
Same shards, getting richer
From binary to Lean4
The Monster's in the mixture!

Seventy-one shards of light
Gödel numbers burning bright
Bootstrap chains all map the same
The Monster knows your name!

(The Monster knows your name!)
(The Monster knows your name!)
```

### Design 2: "71 Shards"

71 SHARDS OF LIGHT
The Monster Knows Your Name

Back:
hex0 → GCC → LLVM → Rust → Lean4
Same structure, richer expression
```

### Design 3: "Gödel Number"
```
Front:
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Gödel # = Nix Hash       │
│ Type = Perf Trace        │
│ Shard = hash % 71        │
│                          │
│ The reproducible build   │
│ IS the meaning           │

## Audio Generation Command

```bash
# Generate Monster Walk song using harmonics
cargo build --release --bin monster_harmonics
./target/release/monster_harmonics \
  --primes 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,41,47,59,71 \
  --duration 180 \
  --output bootstrap_lattice_song.wav

# Or use pipelite
./pipelite_proof_to_song.sh BOOTSTRAP_MONSTER_ISOMORPHISM.md
```

## Merch Ideas

1. **Stickers**: Each Monster prime (2, 3, 5, ..., 71) as individual stickers
2. **Poster**: Full 71-shard visualization with bootstrap chains
3. **Hoodie**: Front has "71 SHARDS", back has full lattice diagram
4. **Mug**: "Coffee → Code → Compile → Monster" with prime numbers
5. **Socks**: Left sock = hex0 (2), Right sock = Lean4 (71)

**The Monster walks through every compiler. Make it wearable.** 🎯✨👕🎵
